        <p><em>Thiruvananthapuram</em>, formerly known as Trivandrum, is the capital of Kerala, a state in southern India. Thiruvananthapuram is bounded by Arabian Sea on the west and Tamil Nadu on its east. The city‟s name was reinstated in the year 1991. Thiruvananthapuram is one of the most attractive tourist destinations in God‟s Own Country. Beaches, green hills, backwaters, wildlife sanctuaries, and islands are all accessible from this enchanting city. Thiruvananthapuram, though serving as a base for other destinations, has its own attractions. Elegant architecture, holy places, beautiful beaches, Ayurveda centres, shopping malls, and so much more can be found here. Trivandrum is a fascinating getaway to start or end your Kerala vacation. The lovely capital city is the centre of industry and development, but it is mostly seen as a gateway to Kovalam by tourists. It is known as the “Paradise of the South” because it is one of India’s most beautiful beaches, located 16 kilometres from Trivandrum. In the local language, “Kovalam” translates to “grove of coconut trees.” The town welcomes visitors with a view of endless coconut trees, a crescent-shaped shoreline, and three beaches. Wonderful palaces, sacred temples, fascinating museums with a rich history and culture, and mesmerising beaches are among the must-see attractions.</p>
