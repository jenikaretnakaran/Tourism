    <div class="description">
        <p><em>Palakkad</em> is one of the fourteen districts of Kerala and has no coastal line. The district opens the
            state to the rest of the country through the
            Palakkad Gap with a width of 32 to 40 Kms. Its geographical position, historical background, educational
            status, tourism hot-spots and above all, the
            development activities that are carried out, are wide and varied. The district is one of the main granaries
            of Kerala and its economy is primarily
            agricultural. The district is also the land of Palmyrahs.Palakkad is also known as the rice bowl of Kerala.
            The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy
            battlements, a moat, and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. North on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century
            Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the
            Ratholsavam chariot festival. Northeast, near Malampuzha Dam, the town of Malampuzha has a rock garden
            created from recycled materials. The river
            Bharathappuzha flows through Palakkad. Palakkad is located on the northern bank of Bharathappuzha River.</p>
